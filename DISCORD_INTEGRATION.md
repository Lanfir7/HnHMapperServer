# Discord Integration Guide

Complete guide for setting up timer notifications in Discord for HavenMap.

---

## Overview

HavenMap can send beautiful, rich-formatted notifications to Discord when timers expire or approach expiry. Each tenant can configure their own Discord webhook to receive notifications in their dedicated channel.

**Supported Notifications:**
- ⏰ Pre-expiry warnings at 4 intervals: 1 day, 4 hours, 1 hour, 10 minutes
- 🔔 Timer expiration notifications
- 📍 Clickable map links that navigate directly to marker locations
- 🎨 Marker icons displayed as thumbnails

---

## Discord Setup (One-Time per Channel)

### Step 1: Create a Discord Channel

1. Open your Discord server
2. Create a new text channel (or use an existing one)
   - Recommended name: `#havenmap-timers` or `#map-notifications`
3. Ensure you have "Manage Webhooks" permission in this channel

### Step 2: Create a Webhook

1. **Right-click** the channel → **Edit Channel**
2. Navigate to **Integrations** tab (left sidebar)
3. Click **Create Webhook** or **View Webhooks**
4. Click **New Webhook** button

### Step 3: Configure the Webhook

1. **Name**: Give it a recognizable name
   - Example: `HavenMap Notifications`
2. **Icon** (Optional): Upload a custom avatar for the bot
3. **Channel**: Verify it's pointing to the correct channel
4. Click **Copy Webhook URL** button
   - The URL will look like: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
5. Click **Save Changes**

⚠️ **Keep this URL secret!** Anyone with the webhook URL can post messages to your channel.

---

## Application Setup

### Step 1: Access Admin Panel

1. Log in to HavenMap with an admin account
2. Navigate to **Admin** page (top navigation)
3. Click the **Settings** tab

### Step 2: Configure Discord Integration

1. Scroll to the **Discord Integration** section
2. Toggle **Enable Discord Notifications** to **ON**
3. Paste your webhook URL into the **Webhook URL** field
   - Make sure it starts with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`
4. Click **Test Connection** button
   - Check your Discord channel for a test message
   - If successful, you'll see: "✅ Test Notification - Your Discord webhook is configured correctly!"
5. Click **Save Settings**

## Notification Types

### 1. Pre-Expiry Warnings

The system sends 4 warnings before a timer expires:

| Warning | Time Before | Priority | Color | Emoji |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| First   | 1 day       | Normal   | Blue  | 📅    |
| Second  | 4 hours     | Normal   | Blue  | ⏰    |
| Third   | 1 hour      | High     | Orange| ⏱️    |
| Fourth  | 10 minutes  | Urgent   | Red   | ⚠️    |

**Example Message:**
```
📅 Tree Stump - 1 day remaining
Timer will expire in approximately 1 day
```

### 2. Timer Expired

Sent when a timer reaches its expiry time:

| Type | Priority | Color | Emoji |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Expired | Normal | Blue | 🔔 |

**Example Message:**
```
🔔 Tree Stump is ready!
Resource is ready to be harvested
```

### 3. Rich Embed Features

All notifications include:
- **Clickable Title**: Click to navigate directly to the marker on the map
- **Thumbnail**: Displays the marker's icon (top-right corner)
- **Map Preview**: 400x400px composite image showing 4x4 grid of tiles around the marker (full-width)
- **Marker Indicator**: Red crosshair pin showing exact marker location on the preview
- **Timestamp**: Shows when the notification was created
- **Color Coding**: Visual priority indication (Blue/Orange/Red)
- **Footer**: "HavenMap Notification"

**Map Preview Details:**
- Shows 4x4 grid of map tiles (400x400 pixels total)
- Marker is centered in the preview
- Red crosshair (+) marks exact marker position
- Provides visual context of surrounding area
- Automatically generated for all marker-based notifications
- Preview images cached for 7 days

---

## How the System Works

### Background Processing

- **Timer Check Service** runs every 30 seconds
- Checks all active timers for all tenants
- Sends notifications immediately when thresholds are reached
- Prevents duplicate warnings using `TimerWarnings` tracking table

### Warning Logic

For each timer, the system checks if the remaining time matches any warning interval (±30 seconds tolerance):

```
Current Time -> Timer Ready Time
         ^
         |
    Check Points:
    - 1440 minutes (1 day)
    - 240 minutes (4 hours)
    - 60 minutes (1 hour)
    - 10 minutes
    - 0 minutes (expired)
```

Each warning is sent **only once** per timer. If a timer is updated/reset, warning history is cleared and warnings will be sent again.

### Notification Flow

1. **Timer Check Service** detects timer threshold
2. Creates notification in database
3. Sends to Discord webhook (fire-and-forget, non-blocking)
4. Records warning in `TimerWarnings` table
5. Broadcasts real-time update via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

---

## Testing

### Creating Test Timers

To test the notification system:

1. **For 10-minute warning**:
   - Create a timer that expires in 11 minutes
   - Wait ~60 seconds
   - You should receive the ⚠️ 10-minute warning

2. **For 1-hour warning**:
   - Create a timer that expires in 61 minutes
   - Wait ~60 seconds
   - You should receive the ⏱️ 1-hour warning

3. **For immediate expiry**:
   - Create a timer that expires in 1 minute
   - Wait ~60 seconds
   - You should receive the 🔔 expiration notification

### Expected Behavior

- **Markers**: Notification includes clickable link and icon thumbnail
- **Standalone Timers**: Notification shows title and description
- **Multiple Warnings**: Each warning sent only once per timer
- **Tenant Isolation**: Only timers for your tenant trigger notifications to your webhook

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Notifications Appearing

**Check 1: Discord Integration Enabled**
- Admin → Settings → Discord Integration
- Verify toggle is **ON**
- Verify webhook URL is correct

**Check 2: Test Connection**
- Click "Test Connection" button
- If test fails, webhook URL may be invalid

**Check 3: Timer Check Service Running**
- Check application logs for: "Timer Check Service started"
- Service should log: "Processed X expired timers and Y pre-expiry warnings"

**Check 4: Webhook URL Format**
- Must start with: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`
- Must contain webhook ID and token
- No trailing slashes or extra characters

**Check 5: Discord Permissions**
- Webhook must have permission to post in channel
- Channel must not be deleted or archived

### Test Message Works, But Timer Notifications Don't

**Check Timer Ready Time**
- Verify timer has correct expiry time (UTC)
- Use database viewer: Admin → Database → Timers table
- Check `ReadyAt` column is in the future

**Check Warning Already Sent**
- Database viewer → TimerWarnings table
- Look for entries with your timer's ID
- If warning exists, it won't be sent again

**Check Logs**
- Application logs should show:
  - "Pre-expiry warning sent for timer {ID}"
  - "Timer {ID} expired"
- If missing, timer may not be in correct state

### Duplicate Notifications

**Cause**: Database migration didn't apply properly
- `TimerWarnings` table missing
- Warnings not being tracked

**Fix**:
1. Check database schema includes `TimerWarnings` table
2. Restart application to apply migrations
3. Clear any stuck warnings: Delete from `TimerWarnings` table

### Webhook Rate Limiting

Discord webhooks have rate limits:
- **30 requests per minute** per webhook
- **Burst limit**: 5 requests per 5 seconds

If you have many timers expiring simultaneously, some notifications may be delayed or dropped.

**Solutions**:
- Stagger timer creation times
- Use multiple webhooks for different timer types (requires code changes)

## Security Considerations

### Webhook URL Security

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Your webhook URL is a secret credential!

**If compromised, attackers can:**
- Post spam messages to your Discord channel
- Impersonate the HavenMap bot
- Send @everyone/@here mentions

**Best Practices:**
1. **Never share** the webhook URL publicly
2. **Never commit** webhook URLs to version control
3. **Regenerate** webhook if URL is leaked (Discord → Edit Webhook → Copy Webhook URL)
4. **Restrict access** to admin panel (only trusted users)
5. **Use HTTPS** for HavenMap deployment (prevents URL interception)

### Database Security

Webhook URLs are stored in the `Tenants` table:
- Column: `DiscordWebhookUrl`
- Tenant-isolated (each tenant has their own webhook)
- Protected by ASP.NET Core authentication/authorization

**Production Recommendations:**
- Encrypt database at rest
- Use secure file permissions for `grids.db`
- Regular database backups

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Discord Channels

Each tenant can have **one webhook URL**. To send notifications to multiple channels:

**Option 1: Discord Webhook Forwarding**
- Use a Discord bot to forward messages from one channel to others
- Requires custom bot development

**Option 2: Multiple Tenants**
- Create separate tenants for different groups
- Each tenant has its own webhook and timers

### Custom Notification Filtering

Currently, **all timer notifications** are sent to Discord (warnings + expiry).

To customize which notifications are sent, you would need to modify the code:

**File**: `HnHMapperServer.Services/Services/NotificationService.cs`

**Example**: Only send expiry notifications (no warnings)
```csharp
// Around line 96, add condition:
if (tenant?.DiscordNotificationsEnabled == true &&
    !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(tenant.DiscordWebhookUrl) &&
    dto.Type != "TimerPreExpiryWarning") // Skip warnings
{
    await _discordWebhookService.SendNotificationAsync(notificationDto, tenant.DiscordWebhookUrl);
}
```

### Base URL Configuration

For clickable map links to work correctly, the application needs to know its public URL.

**Configuration**: `appsettings.json` or environment variable
```json
{
  "Discord": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://your-domain.com"
  }
}
```

**Fallback**: Uses `Kestrel:Endpoints:Http:Url` if not specified.

**Docker**: Set environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  api:
    environment:
      - Discord__BaseUrl=https://map.yourdomain.com
```

## FAQ

### Q: Can I test the webhook URL before saving?
**A**: Yes! Click the "Test Connection" button. A test message will be sent to your Discord channel immediately.

### Q: Will I get spammed with notifications?
**A**: No. Each warning is sent **only once** per timer. You'll receive exactly 5 notifications per timer (4 warnings + 1 expiry).

### Q: Can I disable specific warning levels?
**A**: Not through the UI. You would need to modify `TimerCheckService.cs` and remove intervals from the `WARNING_INTERVALS` array.

### Q: Do notifications work for standalone timers without markers?
**A**: Yes! Standalone timers receive the same warnings, but without map links or icon thumbnails.

### Q: What happens if Discord is down?
**A**: Notifications fail silently (fire-and-forget). In-app notifications still work normally. Discord notifications will not be retried.

### Q: Can I customize the message format?
**A**: Yes, by modifying `DiscordWebhookService.cs` → `BuildEmbedAsync()` method. You can change colors, emojis, fields, and formatting.

### Q: How do I disable Discord notifications temporarily?
**A**: Admin → Settings → Toggle "Enable Discord Notifications" to **OFF**. Webhook URL remains saved.

### Q: Can multiple users receive notifications?
**A**: Yes! All users with access to the Discord channel will see notifications. Notifications are sent to the channel (via webhook), not to individual users.

### Q: How do I change which channel receives notifications?
**A**: Edit the webhook in Discord (or create a new one) and update the webhook URL in HavenMap admin settings.

### Q: Why don't I see map previews in Discord?
**A**: Map previews are only generated for marker-based notifications (not standalone timers). If you still don't see them:
1. Check application logs for: "Added map preview to Discord notification"
2. Verify tiles exist for the marker's location (preview needs tiles to composite)
3. Check preview directory exists: `map/previews/{tenantId}/`
4. Preview generation failures are non-critical and won't block notifications

### Q: Can I disable map previews?
**A**: Not through the UI currently. To disable, comment out the preview generation code in `DiscordWebhookService.cs` lines 294-376.

### Q: How much storage do map previews use?
**A**: Each preview is ~40-60KB. With 7-day retention and frequent notifications, expect ~1-5MB per tenant. Previews are automatically cleaned up after 7 days.
